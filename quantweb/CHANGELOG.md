### Warning
_We could not update webpack past version 4 and node-sass past version 5 due to some warnings from NextJS._
_The following warnings come from some of our dependencies, however they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product - we are thinking of dropping their usage and replace with other dependencies:_
```
npm WARN react-datetime@3.0.4 requires a peer of react@^16.5.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
```

## [1.1.0] 2020-05-08
### Bug fixing
- `https://github.com/creativetimofficial/nextjs-material-kit/issues/10` (changed the `title`, from simple `string` to `node`, so now, you can pass a title like so `title={<Link href="/"><a>Free Chat</a></Link>}` if you want to have link functionality - NOTE: the `node` that you pass to the `InfoArea` component will have to be styled)

### Warning
_The following warnings come from some of our dependencies, however they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product - if the issues will persist and will change into errors in the next version of React (v17), we will drop their usage and replace with other dependencies:_
```
npm WARN deprecated popper.js@1.16.1: Popper changed home, find its new releases at @popperjs/core
npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm WARN deprecated mkdirp@0.5.3: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
```
_The following dependencies raise warnings (of deprecation or renamed) in development mode: DateTime, ReactSwipableView. If the warnings will persist, and will become errors in React 17, we will drop their usage and replace them with other plugins._
