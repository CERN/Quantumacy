### Content

* QKDSimkit is a simulator for quantum key distribution, it allows to exchange symmetric keys, there are two different interfaces: peer-to-peer and client-server; [QKDSimkit](QKDSimkit)
* Fork of Openfl that integrates QKDSimkit in its transport protocol; [openfl-develop](openfl-develop)
* Some of the deep learning models we used in our use cases, for example chestscan is used in openfl-develop; [dl_models](dl_models)
* The Homomorphic Encryption Inference Use Case proposes an innovative setup where a two-fold quantum resilient encryption setup (QKD + Homomorphic Encryption) is used for privacy-preserving machine learning inference. It is based on 3 entities, client, storage, and server (processing).
