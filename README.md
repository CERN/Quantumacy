This is the official repository of the Quantumacy project, for more information check our [website]().  
* QKDSimkit is a simulator for quantum key distribution; [QKDSimkit](QKDSimkit)
* a fork of Openfl that integrates QKDSimkit in its transport protocol; [openfl-develop](openfl-develop)
* some of the deep learning models we used in our use cases; [dl_models](dl_models)
* The Homomorphic Encryption Inference Use Case proposes an innovative setup where a two-fold quantum resilient encryption setup (QKD + Homomorphic Encryption) is used for privacy-preserving machine learning inference. It is based on 3 entities, client, storage, and server (processing).
