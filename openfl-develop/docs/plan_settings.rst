Plan Settings
***************

The Federated Learning (FL) plan is described by ``plan.yaml`` file located in ``plan`` folder of the workspace.
Each YAML top-level section contains 3 main subsections:

* ``template``: name of the class including top-level packages names.
  An instance of this class is created when plan gets initialized.
* ``settings``: arguments that are passed to the class constructor
* ``defaults``: file that contains default settings for this subsection.
  Any setting from defaults file can be overriden in ``plan.yaml`` file.

Example of ``plan.yaml``:

.. literalinclude:: ../fledge-workspace/torch_cnn_mnist/plan/plan.yaml
  :language: yaml
