# Quantum-Key-Distribution
A modified BB84 protocol utilizing emulated photons for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).

# Point
Considering that we don't have an access to Quantum Computer yet, we will utilize emulated photons for key distribution. A protocol is modified - the common attacking methods such as eavesdropping can be avoided by the channel (classical server in this case) controlling pulses. Emulated photons in this case are in ideal environment, thus we use perfect single photon source. 

# Example
Quantum channel is initiated. Both **Bob** (receiver) and **Alice** (sender) known the ip address of this quantum channel.

**input:**

```python
from channel import public_channel
public_channel.initiate_server()
```

**server output:**
```
initiated the channel on xxx.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx, waiting for clients...
```

Bob starts listening to quantum channel.

**input:**

```python
from receiver import receiver
bob = receiver()
bob.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
bob.listen_quantum()
```

**server output:**

```
xxx.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx has connected.
```

Alice sends a photon pulse to Bob.

**input:**

```python
from sender import sender
alice = sender()
alice.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
photon_pulse = alice.create_photon_pulse()
alice.send_photon_pulse(photon_pulse)
```

**server output:**

```
xxx.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx has connected.
xxx.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx: qpulse:170
xxx.xxx.x.xxx:xxxx: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Alice and Bob reset their sockets.

**input:**
```python
bob.reset_socket()
```

**input 2:**

```python
alice.reset_socket()
```

After quantum channel is closed, classical channel is initiated. Both Bob and Alice known the ip address of this classical channel.

**input:**

```python
from channel import public_channel
public_channel.initiate_server()
```

Bob listens to public classical channel.

**input:**

```python
bob.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
bob.listen_classical()
```

Alice sends her basis to Bob over public classical channel.

**input:**
```python
alice.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
alice.send_classical_bits(alice.basis)
```

Alice listens to public classical channel.

**input:**

```python
alice.reset_socket()
alice.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
alice.listen_classical()
```

Bob sends his randomly measured basis over public classical channel.
```python
bob.reset_socket()
bob.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
bob.send_classical_bits(bob.basis)
```

Alice & Bob validate their shared bases, whether or not they are similar enough, then they can notify each other.

**input 1:**

```python
decision = alice.validate()
```

**input 2:**

```python
decision = bob.validate()
```

Finally, Alice & Bob exchange their decisions on classical public channel.


Bob listens to public classical channel.

**input:**

```python
bob.reset_socket()
bob.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
bob.listen_classical()
```

Alice sends her decision to Bob over public classical channel.

**input:**
```python
alice.reset_socket()
alice.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
alice.send_classical_bits(decision)
```

Alice listens to public classical channel.

**input:**

```python
alice.reset_socket()
alice.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
alice.listen_classical()
```

Bob sends his decision over public classical channel.
```python
bob.reset_socket()
bob.connect_to_channel('xxx.xxx.x.xxx', xxxx)
bob.send_classical_bits()
```

If both of the users decide to use the key, Alice and Bob will have identical keys and then they can use some symmetric algorithm such as OTP (One Time Pad) or AES (Advanced Encryption Sequence) to communicate. Otherwise, this process is repeated.
